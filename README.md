# NYTReactSearch

This app uses the full MERN stack to create a New York Times search engine.  I used Mongo as a database, Express for the routes, React for the reactive design of the page, and Node as the engine.

#### Install Instructions

After git clone run `npm install` or `npm i` to install all packages inside of the package.json
